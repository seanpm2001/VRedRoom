# VRedRoom

VR RedRoom is a VR simulation program that creates a private room (or sex dungeon) environment in VR. This project is only for those 18 years or older.

> **Note** I need GitHub to age-restrict this repository. Sexual content is not included by default, but it is still a sensitive project.

## Features:

- Customizable rooms with maximum pleasure built in (Red rooms)
- The ability to use a web browser and file manager within the program

## Program rating:

- 18+ (for certain use)
- 13+ (for other use)

## Languages

VRedRoom is written primarily in Red, but also contains C, VHDL, and WebAssembly source code.

Red is used for the majority of application functions, C is used for the backend, WebAssembly is used for the web browser layer, and VHDL (and C) are used for VR headsets and other hardware drivers.

## Default rooms

- Cube
- Pine forest
- Taiga
- Antarctica
- Igloo
- AR (your own house)
- Oven
- Rotisserie <!-- (dildo plugin immersive experience) !-->
- Custom

Rooms are known as redRooms, and are contained in `*.rroom` files, which contain XML, SVG, YAML, and JSON data.

## Privacy

By default, VRedRoom may ask you to turn off your Internet connection before usage for extra safety. As like my other programs, VRedRoom **does not collect user data**

Telemetry is disabled by default (and always will be)

Not a single byte of data will be collected without the full consent of the user.
